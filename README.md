# REACT Application with Pre-render State v2.0 

## Docker - Development Environment

If you do not want to use docker on your system skip this step, but it is recommended that
you use docker, to avoid conflicting dependencies

To start the docker development environment with webpack watch run:

```
docker-compose up
```


This compiles the assets and runs the application at:

```
http://localhost:3000
````

Webpack watch will also be running to reflect any changes made during development


## Docker - Production Build

To build the production version of the application

```
docker build -t <name of container> -f Dockerfile.prod .
```
To test the production build

```
docker run --name app -p 80:3000 <name of container>
```
